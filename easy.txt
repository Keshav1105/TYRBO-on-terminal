once upon a time a clever monkey resided on a tree that bore fresh luscious berries
a day arrived when a crocodile swam up to the tree and told the monkey that he had travelled
a very long distance and was extremely exhausted from his journey 
the crocodile had been in search of food and was very hungry on hearing this
 the kind monkey offered him a few berries for which the crocodile was very thankful
 asked the monkey if he could visit him again soon for some fruit
the monkey happily agreed the crocodile came back the next day
and the day after that soons this became a daily ritual and they 
grew to become good friends as all friends do they discussed the goings ons of 
their lives and confided in each other
the crocodile told the monkey about his wife who lived on the other side of the river
so the generous monkey offered the crocodile some extra berries to take home for his wife
the crocodile and the monkey continued to grow closer as friends and they ate berries together
the monkey would often give the crocodiles extra berries to take home for his wife
because of how close the two friends had become the crocodile wife started growing jealous
she wanted to put an end to their friendship she thought to herself that if the monkey
survived on a diet of the tasty berries his flesh must be really sweet 
so she asked the crocodile to invite his friend over to dinner
the crocodile refused because he knew that his wife was up to some nasty trick
however she was determined to eat the monkey flesh
she pretended to fall ill and told the crocodile that her doctor claims that the only thing
that would keep her from dying is a monkeys heart
on hearing this the crocodile rushed to the monkeys tree and lied to
him saying that his wife had prepared them a delicious dinner
the monkey happily agreed and climbed onto the crocodiles back
halfway through the monkey noticed that the crocodile began to sink
frightened the monkey asked his friend why he was doing that
the crocodile explained the situation truthfully the clever monkey told him
that this was an unfortunate situation because he had left his heart at home
if the crocodile took him back he would gladly give his heart away to 
nurse the crocodiles wife back to health the silly crocodile fell for the monkeys
clever lie and rushed back to the tree so that he could take the monkeys heart
as soon as they reached the monkey hastily scampered up to safety and told
the crocodile to tell his wife that she had married a fool!
